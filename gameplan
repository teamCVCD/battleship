Objective: create a console/textmode Battleship clone

Ideas:
-Array to represent board (10x10 size, 1-10 for rows, A-J for columns)
  -possibly implement different board sizes/custom
-Allow freedom of ship size/shape, but require that all given 'tiles' be used (to prevent someone from simply putting a one-block ship and turtling)
-New ships would be another dimension of board array, so 3-dimensional
-potentially implement record of won games
-AI and difficulties?

Stretch Ideas:
-GUI/ASCII art, sound effects
-LAN play
-different profiles?
